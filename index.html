      Whether it's getting up early to host a hump day or post-hump day mornings
      show on FBi, siphoning energy into her Sittin' Pretty events, or remaining
      cool calm and collected with only half a pair of USBs,
      <strong>Eddy Diamond</strong> is the musical force we're eternally
      grateful to have in our lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her work both inside and out of the music scene helps ensure the many
      voices of different groups in Sydney are heard. Whether it be throwing
      gigs that showcase upcoming talent or organising community projects, the
      success of these events are a testament to the impact someone can have
      when truly engaged in their community.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not afraid to jump genres when it feels right, and equipped with a
      prescient knowledge of many scenes under the moon, we couldn't think of
      anyone better to join the dots for us between this decade and the next.

      Currently residing in Melbourne, <strong>Martha</strong> has swiftly
      earned a reputation for her specialist twelve inch selections, crafty
      overlaying of spoken samples, and seamless transitions between BRUK,
      breaks, drum n bass and jazzy numbers.
    </p>
    <p>
      After playing some ripper parties recently in support of Sleep D and
      Antiphon, we're excited to support her in making the trip up to Sydney to
      see what our crates and dancers have to offer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Combining this rap with with her truly underground mixes as Subterranean
      Jazz Club, expect a Sydney debut set that melds a wholesome musical
      summary of the year just passed with a crystal clear vision of the sounds
      we have lying ahead.
