      Currently residing in Melbourne, <strong>NüMartha</strong> has swiftly
      earned a reputation for her specialist twelve inch selections, crafty
      overlaying of spoken samples, and seamless transitions between BRUK,
      breaks, drum n bass and jazzy numbers.
    </p>
    <p>
      After playing some ripper parties recently in support of Sleep D and
      Antiphon, we're excited to support her in making the trip up to Sydney to
      see what our crates and dancers have to offer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Combining this rap with with her truly underground mixes as Subterranean
      Jazz Club, expect a Sydney debut set that melds a wholesome musical
      summary of the year just passed with a crystal clear vision of the sounds
      we have lying ahead.

      Mastermind behind the always sweaty Athletica club nights,
      <strong>ISA</strong> has made massive waves across Sydney in 2019. Not
      afraid to jump genres when it feels right, as a DJ she flawlessly weaves
      upbeat club tracks with sparkles and sugar that'll have you bouncing along
      as she takes control of the decks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Combining this energetic style with a prescient knowledge of emerging
      scenes and artists, she has landed peak time slots at Secret Garden
      Festival, Purple Sneakers 12th Birthday, FBi Radio Club Night #2, and
      Melbourne's Rogue Cuts, as well as mixes on Triple J, FBi Radio and
      London's Reprezent, and even formed her own Athletica show on Nomad radio.
    </p>
    <p>
      We've been secretly admiring her music, parties and expertise for far too
      long now, and couldn't think of anyone better to join the dots for us
      between this decade and the next.
