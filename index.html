      Whether it's getting up early to host a hump day or post-hump day mornings
      show on FBi, siphoning energy into her Sittin' Pretty events, or remaining
      cool calm and collected with only half a pair of USBs,
      <strong>Eddy Diamond</strong> is the musical force we're eternally
      grateful to have in our lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her work both inside and out of the music scene, be it throwing gigs that
      showcase upcoming talent or helping organise community projects, help
      ensure the many voices of different groups in Sydney are heard and are a
      testament to the impact that a person can have when truly engaged in their
      community.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not afraid to jump genres when it feels right, and equipped with a
      prescient knowledge of many scenes under the moon, we couldn't think of
      anyone better to join the dots for us between this decade and the next.

      After a recent trip to suss out what our crates have to offer,
      <strong>Martha</strong> has decided to return north once more this year to
      inspect the state of the dancers as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently residing in Melbourne, she has swiftly earned a reputation for
      her specialist twelve inch selections, crafty overlaying of spoken
      samples, and seamless transitions between BRUK, breaks, drum n bass and
      jazz numbers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Combining this rap with with her truly underground mixes as Subterranean
      Jazz Club, expect a Sydney debut set that melds a wholesome musical
      summary of the year just passed with a crystal clear vision of the future
      sounds ahead.
