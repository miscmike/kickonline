      Whether it's getting up early to host a hump day or post-hump day mornings
      show on FBi, siphoning energy into her Sittin' Pretty events, or remaining
      cool calm and collected with only half a pair of USBs,
      <strong>Eddy Diamond</strong> is the musical force we're eternally
      grateful to have in our lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her work both inside and out of the music scene, whether it be throwing
      gigs that showcase upcoming talent or helping organise community projects,
      help ensure the many voices of different groups in Sydney are heard and
      are a testament to the impact that a person can have when truly engaged in
      their community.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not afraid to jump genres when it feels right, and equipped with a
      prescient knowledge of many scenes under the moon, we couldn't think of
      anyone better to join the dots for us between this decade and the next.

      After a recent trip to Sydney suss out what our crates have to offer,
      <strong>Martha</strong> has decided to return once more this year to
      inspect the state of the dancers as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the last 12 months, she has swiftly earned a reputation for
      specialist twelve inch selections, and seamless transitions through an
      array of BRUK, breaks, drum n bass and jazz records.
    </p>
    <p>
      Combining this rap with with her truly underground mixes as Subterranean
      Jazz Club, we can't wait for her to meld a wholesome musical summary of
      the year behind us with a crystal clear vision of the hot notes we're to
      hear in the year ahead.

      Always sporting a warming smile, and never far from the renegade action,
      Dejaan's presence always makes for a special party.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wlling to go the extra mile to make an event run smoothly, and equipped
      with an expert skill in tuning sound just right for a room, he never
      ceases bring his own unique touch to a night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Combining all this with an innate taste for rare late night dubs, early
      morning rhythms, and everything in-between, we couldn't think of anyone
      better to take us into the early hours of 2020. <br />
      Keep your eyes peeled for his summer ***** parties too!
